# Advanced Data Mining Project

This repository contains tasks related to data preprocessing, clustering, and advanced data mining techniques, including hierarchical clustering, k-means, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The `preprocessing_code.ipynb` notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Similarity and distance calculations (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and Cosine)
- Feature scaling and transformation

### 2. Clustering Techniques
The `clustering_code.ipynb` notebook implements:
- Hierarchical clustering (single and complete linkage)
- k-means clustering
- k-medoids clustering
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA

### 3. Advanced Data Mining (Music Data)
The `music_clustering.ipynb` notebook explores:
- Hierarchical clustering on music features to discover clusters based on artist and type.

## Datasets
1. `college_data.csv`: Data on various colleges used for clustering and preprocessing.
2. `music2.csv`: Music data used for clustering and analysis.

## Running the Notebooks
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
